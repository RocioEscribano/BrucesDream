            <article>
                <p>Bruce Leslie McLaren (30 August 1937 – 2 June 1970) was a racing driver from New Zealand, as well as
                    an automotive designer, engineer, and sports executive, who participated in Formula One between 1958
                    and 1970. In 1960, McLaren finished second in the Formula One World Drivers' Championship alongside
                    Cooper and secured four Grand Prix victories over 13 seasons. In endurance racing, McLaren triumphed
                    at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966 alongside Ford. He established McLaren in 1963, and they have
                    since secured nine World Constructors' Championship titles, remaining the sole team to have achieved
                    the Triple Crown of Motorsport.</p>

                <p>Born and raised in Auckland, McLaren initially studied engineering at the University of Auckland
                    before dropping out to focus on his motor racing career. Having entered his first hillclimbing event
                    aged 14, he progressed to Formula Two in 1957, winning the New Zealand Championship the following
                    year. His performance at the New Zealand Grand Prix attracted the attention of Jack Brabham, whom he
                    partnered at Cooper in 1959 having already debuted at the 1958 German Grand Prix, where he finished
                    fifth in his Formula Two machinery. Aged 22, McLaren took his maiden win at the United States Grand
                    Prix, becoming the then-youngest driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix, a record which stood for 44
                    years. Remaining at Cooper for 1960, McLaren took a further win in Argentina—amongst several
                    podiums—as he finished championship runner-up to teammate Brabham. After a winless 1961 season for
                    Cooper, Brabham won the 1962 Monaco Grand Prix, finishing third in the championship to Graham Hill
                    and Jim Clark. Cooper struggled for performance from 1963 to 1965 as Lotus, BRM and Ferrari
                    dominated the championship, prompting McLaren to enter Formula One with his own team. McLaren
                    founded Bruce McLaren Motor Racing in 1963, with whom he competed from 1966 until his death in 1970.
                    With the team, he won the Belgian Grand Prix in 1968 and finished third in the 1969 World Drivers'
                    Championship. In June 1970, he died whilst testing the McLaren M8D at Goodwood, having achieved four
                    wins, three fastest laps and 27 podiums in Formula One.</p>

                <p>Beyond Formula One, McLaren participated in nine versions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans from 1959 to
                    1969, achieving victory in 1966 with Chris Amon in the Ford GT40 Mk II. He was a two-time champion
                    of the Canadian-American Challenge Cup in 1967 and 1969, piloting his M6A and M8B, and triumphed in
                    the Tasman Series in 1964. His legacy is firmly established with the McLaren Group, which has
                    accomplished nine World Constructors' Championships, two Indianapolis 500s, and the 24 Hours of Le
                    Mans in 1995. In 1991, McLaren was honored with induction into the International Motorsports Hall of
                    Fame.</p>

                    <h3>Grand Prix</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Bruce McLaren's standout performance in the 1958 New Zealand Grand Prix captured the interest of
                    Australian driver Jack Brabham, who subsequently asked him to join his team. Acknowledging his
                    capabilities, the New Zealand International Grand Prix organization chose McLaren for its 'Driver to
                    Europe' initiative, designed to offer aspiring Kiwi drivers international racing exposure. McLaren
                    was the inaugural recipient of the program, leading the way for others such as Denny Hulme. He
                    became part of the Cooper team, staying there for seven years, racing in Formula Two and taking part
                    in the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. There, he captivated the racing community by securing
                    first place among F2 vehicles and fifth overall against elite F1 competitors. </p>

                <p> In 1959, McLaren officially became a member of the Cooper factory F1 team with Brabham and triumphed
                    at the United States Grand Prix at merely 22 years and 104 days old, making him the youngest Grand
                    Prix champion then—a record that stood until Fernando Alonso surpassed it in 2003. He achieved
                    another win at the Argentine Grand Prix during the 1960 season, placing second to Brabham. McLaren
                    maintained its success by winning the 1962 Monaco Grand Prix and securing a third-place finish in
                    the championship. In 1963, he established Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd, which is now recognized as
                    McLaren in Formula One.</p>

                <p> After leaving Cooper in 1965, McLaren formed his own Grand Prix team alongside Chris Amon, who
                    departed for Ferrari in 1967. In 1968, Denny Hulme became part of the team, helping achieve its
                    inaugural Grand Prix victory at Spa and earning two wins with the McLaren-Ford. In 1969, McLaren
                    secured third place in the championship, celebrating his New Zealand roots with the "speedy Kiwi"
                    emblem on his vehicles.</p>

                </header>
                <p>McLaren's design flair and ingenuity were graphically demonstrated in powerful sports car racing.
                    Just as the Can-Am began to become very popular with fans in Canada and the U.S., the new McLaren
                    cars finished second twice, and third twice, in six races.</p>

                <p>In 1967, they won five of six races and in 1968, four of six. The following year, McLarens proved
                    unbeatable, winning all 11 races. In two races, they finished 1–2–3.</p>

                </header>
                <p>In 1965, McLaren and co-driver Ken Miles raced a Ford GT40 in the 24 Hour Race at Le Mans. The car
                    was
                    leading after 45 laps but retired due to gearbox failure. In 1966, McLaren and co-driver Chris Amon
                    won the race in a Ford GT40, in a Ford 1-2-3 finish. The Ken Miles-Denny Hulme entry crossed the
                    line first but had travelled less distance due to the Le Mans style start.</p>

            <h2 id="constructor">Career as a constructor</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Bruce McLaren was not only a competitive driver but also an exceptional analyst, engineer, and
                    manager, which solidified the enduring legacy of the McLaren racing team. In the early stages of
                    developing McLaren sports cars, Bruce carefully observed that the fuel filler access door was
                    flapping excessively at higher speeds, contrary to aerodynamic expectations that it should remain
                    firmly secured. Frustrated by this oversight, he made an impulsive modification by cutting the
                    bodywork behind the radiator, which immediately resulted in significantly faster lap times. Through
                    this action, he realized that higher pressure air beneath the door prevented it from being held down
                    by airflow, leading to the innovative "nostrils" design feature that became a signature element in
                    all McLaren cars, including the iconic P1 road car. Recognizing that McLaren’s cars were less
                    innovative than rival Jim Hall’s Chaparrals but demonstrated superior reliability, the team
                    consistently achieved race and championship victories. This culture of reliability endured long
                    after Bruce’s death and was further reinforced by Ron Dennis upon acquiring the team, drawing from
                    Bruce’s foundational experiences as a race mechanic.
