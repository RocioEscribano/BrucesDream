                    <h2>Season 2024: McLaren's Historic Return</h2>
                    <p>The 2024 Formula 1 season was a historic year for McLaren, achieving their first Constructors'
                        Championship in 26 years and solidifying themselves as one of the most competitive teams on the
                        grid. With strategic victories, a highly competitive car, and moments full of drama, the British
                        team proved they are back at the top of motorsport.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h2>The Beginning of the Season</h2>
                    <p>The season began with high expectations, thanks to significant improvements introduced in the
                        MCL60B
                        car. Designed with a focus on aerodynamics, high-speed cornering stability, and tire management,
                        the
                        car showed its potential from the first races. McLaren fielded a solid driver lineup: Lando
                        Norris,
                        already regarded as a rising star, and Australian rookie Oscar Piastri, an emerging talent with
                        a
                        successful history in lower categories.</p>
                    <p>In the early rounds, McLaren faced Red Bull's initial dominance, led by Max Verstappen. However,
                        the
                        British team responded with constant updates to the car, quickly closing the gap.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h2>McLaren's Success</h2>
                    <p>McLaren collected multiple wins throughout the season, with standout performances by both
                        drivers:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Miami Grand Prix: Lando Norris secured his first Formula 1 victory, outpacing Ferrari and
                            Red
                            Bull in a strategic race.</li>
                        <li>Hungarian Grand Prix: Oscar Piastri achieved his first win, showing maturity and skill under
                            pressure in his rookie season.</li>
                        <li>Singapore Grand Prix: Norris delivered flawless driving on the street circuit, cementing
                            McLaren's position as a serious contender.</li>
                        <li>Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: The season concluded with another Norris victory, securing the
                            Constructors' Championship for McLaren.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Both drivers also achieved numerous podiums, consistently posing a threat at the front of the
                        grid.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h2>Season Controversies</h2>
                    <p>The season was not without controversies that brought McLaren into the spotlight:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Internal Clashes at McLaren:</li>
                        <p>During the Belgian Grand Prix, a communication error led to a minor contact between Norris
                            and
                            Piastri, causing internal tensions. While the incident did not affect the final result, it
                            sparked debates about driver management within the team. Zak Brown, the CEO, publicly
                            downplayed
                            the incident but reinforced internal rules on track behavior.</p>
                        <li>Technical Copying Accusations:</li>
                        <p>After McLaren's mid-season car upgrades, Red Bull insinuated that some technical solutions on
                            the
                            MCL60B resembled their own designs too closely. Although FIA investigations found no
                            irregularities, the controversy fueled debates about technical information sharing in
                            Formula 1.
                        </p>
                        <li>Penalty at the Italian Grand Prix:</li>
                        <p>In Monza, Piastri was penalized for exceeding track limits during a key defensive maneuver,
                            costing him a podium finish. The stewards' decision was criticized by McLaren, who argued
                            that
                            similar cases had not been penalized in the same manner.</p>

                    <h2>The Rivalry with Red Bull</h2>
                    <p>The battle between McLaren and Red Bull was one of the main storylines of the season. While
                        Verstappen continued to dominate in the early rounds, McLaren's consistency and ability to
                        improve
                        the car leveled the competition. The turning point was the Dutch Grand Prix, where McLaren
                        achieved
                        a strategic victory, breaking Red Bull's streak of consecutive wins.</p>
                    <p>Sergio Pérez, Red Bull's second driver, had an inconsistent season, allowing McLaren to gain an
                        advantage in the Constructors' standings. Tensions escalated when Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko
                        publicly criticized his team for letting McLaren get so close.</p>
